1. Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
Use the AWS CLI:

aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 696272199193.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

Note: If you receive an error using the AWS CLI, make sure that you have the latest version of the AWS CLI and Docker installed.
Build your Docker image using the following command. You can skip this step if your image is already built:
(cd into dir where dockerfile/code is)

docker build -t lambda-function-docker-repository .

After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

docker tag lambda-function-docker-repository:latest 696272199193.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/lambda-function-docker-repository:latest

Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

docker push 696272199193.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/lambda-function-docker-repository:latest
